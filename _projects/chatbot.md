# Signal LLM Chatbot
For this project, I developed an advanced *Signal-based personal assistant chatbot* using *Signal-cli*, designed to operate entirely within *Signal Private Messenger* while offering a wide range of intelligent, multimodal capabilities.

The assistant integrates several *OpenAI APIs*, enabling natural, contextual conversation through GPT models, *text-to-image generation* with DALL·E, and *speech-to-text transcription* powered by Whisper. These capabilities allow the bot to respond conversationally, generate images on demand, and convert voice messages into text.

To extend functionality beyond conversation, I integrated a suite of *REST APIs* that provide real-time access to weather data, satellite imagery, flight tracking, and IoT device controls—allowing the assistant to fetch information or directly interact with smart-home systems.

For computer-vision capabilities, the bot uses *OpenCV* alongside a *YOLOv8 Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)* for object detection model, enabling it to perform object recognition and tracking. Detected objects and annotated results are delivered directly to the user through Signal, turning the chatbot into a versatile vision-enabled assistant.

This combination of multimodal AI, computer vision, and device integration results in a highly capable, privacy-preserving personal assistant fully contained within the Signal ecosystem.
