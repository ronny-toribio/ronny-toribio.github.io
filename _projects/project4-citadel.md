title: "Citadel Android Application"
summary: "I built an Android app that lets me control all my IoT devices, view home cameras, access an interactive map with weather radar and flight tracking, and share locations with family. It also acts as a client for my robot car, giving me more direct control than my Signal LLM chatbot’s automated agent tools, with each platform serving different purposes."

# Citadel Android Application
I developed an Android application that unifies control and monitoring of all my IoT devices into a single, intuitive interface. The app provides real-time access to my home cameras and includes an interactive map where I can view weather radar, track flights, and share location information with loved ones — and vice versa.

In addition to smart-home management, the application also serves as the primary client for my robot car, offering direct, low-latency control. Compared to the agentic tool-use workflows in my Signal-based LLM chatbot, this app provides a more hands-on, immediate way to interact with my network. Both systems complement each other with their own distinct use cases.
