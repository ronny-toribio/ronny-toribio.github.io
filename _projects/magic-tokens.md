## Coffeeless Magic Tokens React Widget

The coffeeless magic tokens package provides widgets and react hooks for displaying streaming text. We use this package on the Coffeeless Programming Smart Search page for displaying decoded tokens from our RAG semantic search system using a glowing effect.

Our glow widget has light and dark themes that match Coffeeless Programming's day and night themes. You can customize the colors using props. The widget also detects overflow and displays a button that allows you to expand and collapse the widget depending on your needs.
